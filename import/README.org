* Import

  You can import the LC data dump files with:

  #+begin_src bash
    node import/index.js ../data/11*.jsonld
  #+end_src

  Right now, it's pretty slow, like 5min for 1000 records.  Part of that is the
  indexed are already in place so are getting updated a lodt,  and part is the
  Linked data processing, but I need to profile it better.
